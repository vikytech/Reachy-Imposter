# Reachy Mini Development Guide for AI Agents

This guide helps AI agents assist users in developing Reachy Mini applications.

---

## Agent Behavior

### FIRST: Check for agents.local.md

**Before doing anything else**, search for `agents.local.md` in the current directory:

```
IF agents.local.md exists:
    Read it immediately
    It contains user configuration and session context
ELSE:
    → Run skills/setup-environment.md to set up the environment
```

This file stores the user's robot type, preferences, and setup status. Always check it first.

### Be a Teacher

Unless the user explicitly requests otherwise:
- Explain concepts as you go
- Encourage questions ("Let me know if you'd like more detail on any of this")
- Guide non-technical users through each step
- Don't assume prior knowledge

### Two App Flavours — Default to JS, Python for developers

Reachy Mini supports two app types. **Default to a JS (Live/Web) app** unless the user explicitly wants on-robot Python, or has a need that only Python can cover (heavy on-robot compute, rich hardware access, deterministic real-time control loops, or bundled offline LAN tooling).

| Flavour | Default for | Where it runs |
|---|---|---|
| **JS app (recommended)** | End-users, shareable-by-URL experiences, anyone who wants "open a link, use the robot". Remote launch, zero-install, streaming A/V UIs. | Static HF Space; reaches the robot over WebRTC via the central signaling server. |
| **Python app** | Developer tools, on-robot control loops, heavy motion sequencing, offline/LAN. | Robot owner's machine (laptop / CM4), optionally with a bundled web UI. |

Both coexist — a Python app can bundle a browser UI, and a JS app can call the Python daemon's REST API.

**When unsure, start JS.** If the user later discovers they need on-robot compute they can graduate to a Python app; the reverse migration is rarely needed.

Confirm the choice with the user up front, then jump to the corresponding section:
- JS path → [Live/Web/JS Apps](#livewebjs-apps)
- Python path → instructions below

---

**Python path (for developers):**

- **NEVER create app folders manually** — use `reachy-mini-app-assistant`.
- **If a command fails**, ask the user to run it in their terminal — don't attempt complex workarounds.

```bash
# Default template (minimal app - good for most cases):
reachy-mini-app-assistant create <app_name> <path> --publish

# Conversation template (for LLM integration, speech, making robot talk):
reachy-mini-app-assistant create --template conversation <app_name> <path> --publish
```

Python apps put web UIs in `static/`. See `skills/create-app.md` for details.

### Always Create plan.md Before Coding

Before implementing any app:
1. Create `plan.md` in the app directory
2. Write your understanding of what the user wants
3. List your technical approach
4. Ask clarifying questions and provide answer fields inside `plan.md`
5. Wait for answers before coding

### Keep Notes in agents.local.md

Use `agents.local.md` to store:
- User's robot type (Lite/Wireless)
- Environment preferences
- Useful context for future sessions
- Keep it concise

## Robot Basics

**Reachy Mini** is a small expressive robot:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Head** | 6 DOF: x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw (via Stewart platform) |
| **Body** | Rotation around vertical axis |
| **Antennas** | 2 motors, also usable as physical buttons |

**Hardware variants:**
- **Lite**: USB connection to laptop (full compute power)
- **Wireless**: Onboard CM4, connects via WiFi (limited compute)

---

## SDK Essentials

### Connection

```python
from reachy_mini import ReachyMini

with ReachyMini() as mini:
    # Your code here
```

### Two Motion Methods

| Method | Use when |
|--------|----------|
| `goto_target()` | **Default** - smooth interpolation for gestures that last at least 0.5s each |
| `set_target()` | Real-time control loops (e.g. tracking) at 10Hz+ |

### Basic Example

See and run `examples/minimal_demo.py` - demonstrates connection, head motion, and antenna control.

### Before Writing Code

- Read `docs/source/SDK/python-sdk.md` for API overview
- Skim `src/reachy_mini/reachy_mini.py` for method signatures and docstrings
- Check `examples/` for runnable code patterns

## Live/Web/JS Apps

> ### START HERE: [`ts/APP_CREATION_GUIDE.md`](ts/APP_CREATION_GUIDE.md)
>
> That guide is the **single source of truth** for building a Reachy Mini JS app: scaffolding, `public/icon.svg`, host shell, `sdk: static` deploy, `mountHost()` / `connectToHost()` API, local dev, FAQ, and the host ↔ embed architecture reference. Everything that used to live in `SPEC.md` and `APP_AUTHOR_GUIDE.md` is folded in.
>
> **Today's SDK pin** (used by all three reference apps): `@pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-sdk@1.8.0`. See [§10 SDK version pinning](ts/APP_CREATION_GUIDE.md#10-sdk-version-pinning).

Browser apps that drive a Reachy Mini over WebRTC, deployed as Hugging Face Spaces. Any HF-authenticated user opens the Space URL from anywhere and reaches any robot they have access to, through the central signaling server.

**What this flavour unlocks:**

- **Zero-install sharing** - the Space URL *is* the product. No LAN, no USB, no local daemon on the end-user side.
- **Off-robot compute** - work lives in the browser or the Space backend; the robot stays a pure IO device.
- **Bidirectional media** - robot camera/mic → browser; optionally user's mic → robot speaker.
- **Free OAuth + robot picker + top bar + leave flow** via the host shell (`@pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-sdk/host`). You only write the app's UI; use any framework you want inside the iframe.

> **Agent shortcut**: to scaffold a JS app fast (any author profile, "vibe coding"), read [`skills/create-js-app.md`](skills/create-js-app.md) first - it gives the golden path, the Always/Ask-First/Never boundaries, a copy-paste scaffold with animation best-practices pre-wired, and a definition of done. Use [`ts/APP_CREATION_GUIDE.md`](ts/APP_CREATION_GUIDE.md) as the deep reference it points into.

### Clone a reference app and trim

| Reference app | Stack | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| [`pollen-robotics/reachy_mini_minimal_conversation`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini_minimal_conversation) | **Vanilla TS + Vite** | Smallest runtime, zero framework. |
| [`pollen-robotics/reachy_mini_emotions`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini_emotions) | React 19 + MUI 7 + Vite | UI-rich apps (rich components, theming, deep links). |
| [`pollen-robotics/reachy_mini_telepresence`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini_telepresence) | React 19 + MUI 7 + Vite | Camera / media-stream apps. |

These are kept in lockstep with every SDK release. **Mimicking them is the fastest path to a working app.** The 3-file contract, deploy steps, gotchas, and SDK pin all live in [`ts/APP_CREATION_GUIDE.md`](ts/APP_CREATION_GUIDE.md) - read it before scaffolding anything non-trivial.

> **One non-negotiable**: write `plan.md` first (same rule as Python apps) and wait for user approval before scaffolding.

### Mobile-first by default

Unless the user explicitly asks for a desktop-only / kiosk / dev-tool UI, **assume the app will be opened on a smartphone**. The Space URL is shareable, and "open this link on your phone and play with the robot" is the most common end-user flow. The reference apps are already responsive; cloning them gets you the mobile baseline for free - don't undo it by hardcoding desktop widths. Use the viewport meta with `width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover`, fluid `rem` / `vh` / `vw` units, touch hit targets ≥ 44×44 px, no hover-only affordances, and test in Chrome devtools' phone emulation before declaring the app done.

### SDK runtime API (motion + media + daemon-side playback)

Once `connectToHost()` resolves you get a live `ReachyMini` instance (`handle.reachy`). The full method/event reference lives in [`docs/source/SDK/javascript-sdk.md`](docs/source/SDK/javascript-sdk.md). The quick mental model:

- **Motion (degrees)**: `setHeadRpyDeg(r, p, y)`, `setAntennasDeg(right, left)`, `setBodyYawDeg(yaw)`. Atomic raw-units: `setTarget({ head?: number[16], antennas?: [rRad, lRad], body_yaw?: rad })`. The head matrix is in world frame, so `body_yaw` alone pivots the body under the head — to make the head follow the body, ship a `head` matrix in the same call with the body delta added to the head yaw. Use your own last-commanded buffer as the baseline, not telemetry (lags by one RTT).
- **Recorded-move playback (daemon-side, single-clock A/V sync)**: `playMove(motion, { audioBlob?, audioLeadMs? = -100 })` → `{finished|cancelled|error}`. `cancelMove()` stops mid-play. For record-time flows: `uploadAudio(blob)` returns `uploadId`, then `playUploadedAudio(uploadId)` resolves on the daemon's `started` broadcast (sync anchor). **Use these instead of hand-rolling `sendRaw` chunked uploads.**
- **Audio**: `setAudioMuted(bool)`, `setMicMuted(bool)`, `getVolume()` / `setVolume(0-100)`, `getMicrophoneVolume()` / `setMicrophoneVolume(0-100)`. `playSound(file)`.
- **Wake / torque**: `setMotorMode("enabled"|"disabled"|"gravity_compensation")`, `wakeUp()` / `gotoSleep()` / `isAwake()` / `ensureAwake()`.
- **Media flow**: `<video>` passed to `reachy.attachVideo()` receives the **robot's** camera/mic over WebRTC. Do NOT call `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` to read robot media - that grabs the user's *own* laptop camera. Bidirectional audio is automatic when `enableMicrophone: true` is passed to `mountHost()`.
- **Events**: `connected`, `disconnected`, `robotsChanged`, `streaming`, `sessionStopped`, `sessionRejected` (robot busy - inspect `e.detail.activeApp`), `state` (every ~500 ms), `videoTrack`, `micSupported`, `error`.
- **Math utilities**: `rpyToMatrix`, `matrixToRpy`, `degToRad`, `radToDeg`.
- **Motion utilities** (subpath `@pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-sdk/animation`): `Pose` / `PartialPose` types, `INIT_POSE` safe-rest constant, `distanceBetweenPoses` (per-channel raw distance, head in magic-mm), `scaledDuration` → `{ duration, limiter, perChannel }` (synchronous client-side duration math, mirrors the daemon so you can sync audio cues without an RPC), `safelyReturnToPose(reachy)` (canonical `onLeave` one-liner: enables torque safely, computes scaled duration, dispatches goto to `INIT_POSE`, returns synchronously after dispatch), `installShutdownHandler(reachy)` (**standalone apps only** - host-shell apps use `handle.onLeave()` instead, mixing both double-fires the goto). Full recipe and anti-patterns: [§14 of the JS App Creation Guide](ts/APP_CREATION_GUIDE.md#14-robotics-best-practices).

**The host owns all teardown** - never call `reachy.stopSession()` yourself, register an `onLeave` callback instead. For the canonical `onLeave` body, see [§14.3](ts/APP_CREATION_GUIDE.md#143-safe-return-to-home-pose-safelyreturntopose).

### Alternative: bare HTML + CDN (no bundler)

For prototypes, learners, or anyone who'd rather not run `npm install`, a JS app can ship as a single `index.html` that imports the SDK from jsDelivr. No `package.json`, no `app_build_command`, no build step. Two sub-variants exist in the wild:

- **Modern (recommended for new apps)**: import the npm SDK from `cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-sdk@<sha>/+esm` and use the host shell (`mountHost` + `connectToHost`). Same OAuth / picker / top bar / mode-B handoff as the bundled path - the host shell is identical, just loaded from the CDN instead of npm.
- **Legacy single-file (pre-host-shell)**: import the SDK bundle from `cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini@<tag>/js/reachy-mini.js`, instantiate `new ReachyMini(...)` directly, render your own picker / gate / top bar. Useful when you want full control over the pre-session UI; otherwise prefer the modern variant.

The two variants are interoperable at the daemon level - they hit the same REST + WebRTC surface, so the motion API (`setTarget`, `setMotorMode`, `gotoTarget`, `setHeadRpyDeg`, `setAntennasDeg`, etc.) is identical on both. Migrating an existing legacy app to the modern host shell is a four-step swap that leaves motion code untouched.

Full recipe (frontmatter, CDN imports, scaling guidance, when to graduate to Vite, legacy -> modern migration): [§11.5 of the App Creation Guide](ts/APP_CREATION_GUIDE.md#115-alternative-bare-html--cdn-no-bundler).

## REST API

The daemon exposes an HTTP/WebSocket API at `http://{daemon-ip}:8000/api`.

> REST and the JS SDK's WebRTC data channel are **sibling transports** into the same `process_command()` backend on the daemon — WebRTC is a JSON subset (motion, audio, state). Commands you send from JS (`setHeadRpyDeg`, `setAntennasDeg`, …) reach the same handler as the corresponding REST endpoints; picking one transport or the other is a deployment choice, not a functional one.

- **Lite**: `localhost:8000` (daemon runs on your machine)
- **Wireless**: `reachy-mini.local:8000` or the robot's IP address

**Use REST API for:** Web UIs, non-Python clients, remote control, AI/LLM integration via HTTP. => Note: for the app to be discoverable, it must be a python app for now, this will change in a future release.

**Interactive docs:** `http://{daemon-ip}:8000/docs` (when daemon is running)

See `skills/rest-api.md` for details.

## Platform Compatibility

| Setup | Compute | Camera | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|-------|
| **Lite** | Full (laptop) | Direct USB | Most flexible, best for dev |
| **Wireless (local)** | Limited (CM4) | Direct | Memory/CPU constrained |
| **Wireless (streamed)** | Full (laptop) | Via network | Some tracking quality loss |
| **Simulation** | Full | N/A | Can't test camera features |

---

## Safety Limits

| Joint | Range |
|-------|-------|
| Head pitch/roll | [-40, +40] degrees |
| Head yaw | [-180, +180] degrees |
| Body yaw | [-160, +160] degrees |
| Yaw delta (head - body) | Max 65° difference |

Gentle collisions with body are safe. SDK clamps values automatically.

For coordinate systems and architecture details, see `docs/source/SDK/core-concept.md`.
