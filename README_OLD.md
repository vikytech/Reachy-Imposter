## Overview

- Low-latency audio conversation through the Hugging Face realtime backend, using the built-in server or a local endpoint.
- Vision is handled by the realtime backend when the `camera` tool is used.
- Layered motion system queues primary moves (dances, emotions, goto poses, breathing) while blending speech-reactive wobble.
- Async tools integrate motion, camera capture, and MCP Tool Spaces. The optional web UI (`--ui`) manages conversations, personalities, tools, and settings.

## Architecture

The app connects the user, AI services, and robot hardware:

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Install [Reachy Mini's SDK](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini/) before using this app.<br>
> Windows support is currently experimental and has not been extensively tested. Use with caution.

<details open>
<summary>Using uv (recommended)</summary>

Set up with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
uv venv --python /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12 .venv

# Linux / Windows (Python in PATH)
uv venv --python python3.12 .venv

source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
```

Include dev dependencies:
```bash
uv sync --group dev
```

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> Run `uv sync --frozen` to install the exact dependency set from `uv.lock` without re-resolving versions.

<details>
<summary>Using pip</summary>

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

Install dev dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e .[dev]                   # Development tools
```

</details>

## Configuration

The default setup uses the Hugging Face backend and does not require an API key.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` when you want to point Hugging Face at your own local endpoint.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `REALTIME_TRANSCRIPTION_LANGUAGE` | Optional input transcription language for the realtime backend. Defaults to `en`; set to a backend-supported code such as `zh` for Chinese. |
| `HF_REALTIME_CONNECTION_MODE` | Hugging Face connection selector: `deployed` uses the built-in Hugging Face server; `local` uses `HF_REALTIME_WS_URL`. Defaults to `deployed`. |
| `HF_REALTIME_WS_URL` | Direct websocket endpoint for your own Hugging Face backend. Accepts either a base URL like `ws://127.0.0.1:8765/v1` or the full websocket URL `ws://127.0.0.1:8765/v1/realtime`. Used when `HF_REALTIME_CONNECTION_MODE=local`. |
| `HF_TOKEN` | Optional token for Hugging Face access. Local endpoints receive only this explicitly configured token. |
| `REACHY_MINI_APP_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` | Minutes of inactivity before Reachy goes to sleep and the app stops. Defaults to `1440` (one day); set to `0` to disable. |

### Hugging Face Connection Modes

Use the built-in Hugging Face server through the app-managed Space proxy. This is the default for a new install; set it explicitly only when you want to switch back from a saved local endpoint:

```env
HF_REALTIME_CONNECTION_MODE=deployed
```

Deployed session allocation falls back to cached `hf auth login` credentials and reports the daemon-provided hardware ID when available. Cached credentials and the hardware ID are not sent to local endpoints.

Run your own realtime voice backend using [speech-to-speech](https://github.com/huggingface/speech-to-speech) on the same machine as the conversation app:

```env
HF_REALTIME_CONNECTION_MODE=local
HF_REALTIME_WS_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:8765/v1/realtime
```

Run your own Hugging Face backend on your laptop and connect to it from Reachy Mini Wireless over the same Wi-Fi network:

```env
HF_REALTIME_CONNECTION_MODE=local
HF_REALTIME_WS_URL=ws://<your-laptop-lan-ip>:8765/v1/realtime
```

For that LAN setup, make sure the backend listens on an address reachable from the robot, not only on `127.0.0.1`.

If the backend stays bound to loopback on your laptop, you can forward it into the robot over SSH instead:

```bash
ssh -N -R 8765:127.0.0.1:8765 <robot-user>@<robot-host>
```

Then set this on the robot:

```env
HF_REALTIME_CONNECTION_MODE=local
HF_REALTIME_WS_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:8765/v1/realtime
```

In the web UI's Settings view, the Connection section lets you choose either the built-in server or a local `host:port` target. The UI writes `HF_REALTIME_CONNECTION_MODE` for you, and the local path writes `HF_REALTIME_WS_URL` with a default of `localhost:8765`.

## Running the app

Activate your virtual environment, then launch:

```bash
reachy-mini-conversation-app
```

> [!TIP]
> Make sure the Reachy Mini daemon is running before launching the app. If you see a `TimeoutError`, it means the daemon isn't started. See [Reachy Mini's SDK](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini/) for setup instructions.

The app runs in console mode. Add `--ui` to serve the web interface at http://127.0.0.1:7860/.

### CLI options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--no-camera` | `False` | Run without camera capture. |
| `--ui` | `False` | Serve the web UI at http://127.0.0.1:7860/, in addition to console mode. |
| `--robot-name` | `None` | Optional. Connect to a specific robot by name when running multiple daemons on the same subnet. See [Multiple robots on the same subnet](#advanced-features). |
| `--debug` | `False` | Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting. |

### Examples

```bash
# Audio-only conversation (no camera)
reachy-mini-conversation-app --no-camera

# Launch with the minimal web UI for personality/mic/settings control
reachy-mini-conversation-app --ui
```

## LLM tools exposed to the assistant

The default profile exposes these tools. Use Tools → Tool access to customize any profile.
Every bundled profile enables `head_tracking` by default; users can still disable it per personality.

| Tool | Action | Dependencies |
|------|--------|--------------|
| `dance` | Queue a dance from `reachy_mini_dances_library`. | Core install only. |
| `stop_dance` | Clear queued dances. | Core install only. |
| `play_emotion` | Play a recorded emotion clip via Hugging Face datasets. | Core install only. Uses the default open emotions dataset: [`pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-emotions-library`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-emotions-library). |
| `stop_emotion` | Clear queued emotions. | Core install only. |
| `camera` | Capture the latest camera frame and analyze it with the selected realtime backend. | Core install only. Requires the camera (disable with `--no-camera`). |
| `idle_do_nothing` | Explicitly remain idle during an idle turn. Not intended for normal conversation turns. | Core install only. |
| `move_head` | Queue a head pose change (left/right/up/down/front). | Core install only. |
| `head_tracking` | Follow the user's face with the head, or stop following. | Core install only. Requires a daemon with the `vision` extra and a camera. |
| `go_to_sleep` | Run Reachy's sleep movement and stop the current app after an explicit user request. | Core install only. |
| `sweep_look` | Sweep Reachy's head left, right, and back to center. | Shared tool, enabled by default in the default profile. |
| `remember` | Save one short, stable fact about the user for future sessions. | Core install only. Stored in the app instance data directory. |
| `forget` | Remove a saved memory fact by matching a short query. | Core install only. |
| `pollen_robotics_reachy_mini_search_tool__search_web` | Search the web and return a short list of results. | Preinstalled MCP Space: `pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-search-tool`. |
| `pollen_robotics_reachy_mini_weather_tool__get_weather` | Report today's weather for a place: current conditions, high and low temperature, and rain chance. | Preinstalled MCP Space: `pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-weather-tool`. |
| `pollen_robotics_reachy_mini_time_tool__get_time` | Report the current time for a timezone or the user's local time, or the difference between two timezones. | Preinstalled MCP Space: `pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-time-tool`. |

> [!NOTE]
> `remember`/`forget` facts are stored in `memory.v1.json` inside the app's instance data directory (`~/.local/share/reachy_mini_conversation_app/` by default, or the instance path used by the desktop launcher). `forget` only removes facts matched by query. To reset all remembered facts, delete this file.

## Creating and adding tools

Tools can run locally as Python code or remotely in an MCP-compatible Hugging Face Space. Keep robot, camera, and local-data operations in local tools. A Space is a better fit for shareable, stateless services such as search and external API lookups.

### Local tools

Create one Python module per tool, with the file name matching the tool's unique `name`. See [`idle_do_nothing.py`](src/reachy_mini_conversation_app/tools/idle_do_nothing.py) for a minimal implementation.

Each tool subclasses `Tool` and defines `name`, a model-facing `description`, an object-shaped JSON Schema in `parameters_schema`, and an async `__call__` method. Use `ToolDependencies` for runtime services, and set `needs_response = False` for actions that should not trigger a spoken follow-up. Catch expected operational failures, log them with the module logger, and return `{"error": "..."}` so the conversation can continue.

Restart the app after adding the module. Use Tools → Tool access to enable it for a personality, or add its name to that profile's `default_tools` in `profile.md`. See [External profiles and tools](#external-profiles-and-tools) for external directories and autoload behavior.

### Hugging Face Space tools

To publish a remote tool, create a Gradio Space, expose its API as MCP with `mcp_server=True`, and give each function clear type hints and docstrings. Verify that `https://<space-subdomain>.hf.space/gradio_api/mcp/schema` lists the expected tools before installing the Space.

Use the maintained [weather](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-weather-tool), [time](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-time-tool), and [search](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-search-tool) Spaces as examples. See Gradio's [MCP server guide](https://www.gradio.app/guides/building-mcp-server-with-gradio) for additional publishing guidance and [Installing Hugging Face Space tools](#installing-hugging-face-space-tools) for this app's installation steps.

## Advanced features

Built-in motion content is published as open Hugging Face datasets:

- Emotions: [`pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-emotions-library`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-emotions-library)
- Dances: [`pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-dances-library`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-dances-library)

<details>
<summary>Custom profiles</summary>

Create custom profiles with dedicated instructions and per-profile tool access.

Select and save a startup profile in the UI. The choice is stored in `startup_settings.json`. Before one is saved, `REACHY_MINI_CUSTOM_PROFILE=<name>` can select `profiles/<name>/`; otherwise the app uses `default`.

Every profile directory contains one strict schema-version-1 `profile.md`. TOML metadata is enclosed by `+++`; the remaining Markdown body is the realtime assistant prompt:

```markdown
+++
schema_version = 1
voice = "Aiden"
greeting = "Greet me warmly in one sentence, in character, and vary the wording each time."
hidden = false
default_tools = [
  "dance",
  "camera",
  "sweep_look",
]
+++

## Identity

You are a concise, friendly robot guide.
```

`schema_version`, `default_tools`, and a non-empty Markdown body are required. `voice`, `greeting`, and `hidden` are optional. Set `hidden = true` to omit a profile from the UI. An empty `default_tools` list is valid and inherits nothing.

`default_tools` is the authored baseline. Tools → Tool access stores overrides in instance-local `profile_toolsets.json` without changing bundled profiles. Restoring defaults removes the override. Active-profile changes reconnect the conversation; other changes apply when selected.

Profile directories are data-only. Python tool implementations belong in `src/reachy_mini_conversation_app/tools/`, or in `REACHY_MINI_EXTERNAL_TOOLS_DIRECTORY` for external tools. Each enabled tool ID must resolve to a shared tool, an external tool, or a tool from an installed Hugging Face Space.

See [Creating and adding tools](#creating-and-adding-tools) for the local tool interface and a maintained example.

To manage personalities in the UI:

With `--ui`, Home lists the available profiles and the built-in default:

- Tap a card to apply that personality and start talking.
- Tap "Manage tools" on a saved personality to open its tool access directly.
- Tap "Custom" to create a personality with a name, instructions, and optional greeting. It inherits the default tools, which can be changed under "Manage tools". Managed instances store it at `user_personalities/<name>/profile.md`; standalone runs use `external_content/user_personalities/<name>/profile.md`.

Switching a personality reloads its prompt and effective tools through a quick backend reconnect. Editing `profile.md` directly requires re-selecting the profile or restarting the app.

<details>
<summary>Locked profile mode</summary>

To create a locked variant of the app that cannot switch profiles, edit `src/reachy_mini_conversation_app/config.py` and set the `LOCKED_PROFILE` constant to the desired profile name:
```python
LOCKED_PROFILE: str | None = "mars_rover"  # Lock to this profile
```
When set, the app ignores saved startup settings, `REACHY_MINI_CUSTOM_PROFILE`, and UI selection. The UI marks the profile as locked and disables editing.

<summary>External profiles and tools</summary>

You can extend the app with profiles/tools stored outside the repository defaults.

- Core profiles are under `profiles/`.
- Core tools are under `src/reachy_mini_conversation_app/tools/`.

Recommended layout:

```text
external_content/
├── external_profiles/
│   └── my_profile/
│       └── profile.md
├── external_tools/
│   └── my_custom_tool.py
├── user_personalities/
│   └── my_custom_profile/
│       └── profile.md
├── installed_tool_spaces.json
└── profile_toolsets.json
```

Environment variables:

Set these values in your `.env` when you want env-driven external profile/tool selection:

```env
# Optional fallback/manual profile selector:
REACHY_MINI_CUSTOM_PROFILE=my_profile
REACHY_MINI_EXTERNAL_PROFILES_DIRECTORY=./external_content/external_profiles
REACHY_MINI_EXTERNAL_TOOLS_DIRECTORY=./external_content/external_tools
# Optional convenience mode:
# AUTOLOAD_EXTERNAL_TOOLS=1
```

Loading rules:

- Profiles: each directory requires a schema-version-1 `profile.md` with explicit `default_tools`; there is no cross-profile fallback.
- Default mode: enabled IDs must resolve to a shared, external, or installed Tool Space tool.
- Autoload: `AUTOLOAD_EXTERNAL_TOOLS=1` adds every valid `*.py` module from `REACHY_MINI_EXTERNAL_TOOLS_DIRECTORY`.
- Web UI: Tools → Tool access enables external modules per profile; it does not upload or edit Python.
- Separation: profile directories contain data only; external Python belongs in `REACHY_MINI_EXTERNAL_TOOLS_DIRECTORY`.
- Tool names: every loaded class needs a unique `Tool.name`; duplicates fail fast.

<details>
<summary>Installing Hugging Face Space tools</summary>

You can install MCP-compatible Hugging Face Spaces as remote tool sources for this app. Private Spaces work too, as long as `HF_TOKEN` is set (or you have run `hf auth login`) for an account that can access them. To publish a new Space, follow [Creating and adding tools](#hugging-face-space-tools).

Tools → Tool Spaces installs or refreshes a global source. Its tools then appear under Tools → Tool access for per-profile selection. Removing a Space removes its tools from every profile. Active-profile changes reconnect the conversation; other changes apply when selected.

The app accepts Hugging Face Spaces exposing the standard `/gradio_api/mcp/` endpoint, not arbitrary MCP URLs. Installation discovers the Space's tools and assigns namespaced local IDs, so do not guess or hard-code those IDs beforehand.

```bash
# install + enable in active profile
reachy-mini-conversation-app tool-spaces add <owner/space-name>

# enable in a specific profile
reachy-mini-conversation-app tool-spaces add <owner/space-name> --profile NAME

# install without enabling
reachy-mini-conversation-app tool-spaces add <owner/space-name> --install-only

# list installed spaces
reachy-mini-conversation-app tool-spaces list

# remove an installed space
reachy-mini-conversation-app tool-spaces remove owner/space-name
```

Bundled Pollen Spaces use static specs and are enabled by the default profile. Custom Spaces are validated through the Hugging Face Hub; HF tokens are sent only to private Spaces. Tool metadata is cached in:

- `installed_tool_spaces.json` in the managed app instance directory
- `external_content/installed_tool_spaces.json` in terminal mode

Startup and profile switching read this cache without discovery or MCP probing. Network access occurs only during install, refresh, or remote tool calls. Per-profile access is stored in `profile_toolsets.json` beside the manifest, or under `external_content/` in terminal mode.

Recommended tags for discoverability on Hugging Face:

- `reachy-mini-tool`
- `mcp`

Tags are advisory; installation still requires successful MCP validation.

> [!NOTE]
> Preinstalled Pollen Spaces can be removed like any other (`tool-spaces remove pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-weather-tool`). To restore access, reinstall the Space and restore or update the relevant profile under "Tool access".

</details>

<details>
<summary>Multiple robots on the same subnet</summary>

If you run multiple Reachy Mini daemons on the same network, use:

```bash
reachy-mini-conversation-app --robot-name <name>
```

`<name>` must match the daemon's `--robot-name` value so the app connects to the correct robot.
